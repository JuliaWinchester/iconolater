# Iconolater

Iconolater is an in-progress tool for creating labeled images using the HTML5 canvas and paperJS. Image labels are made up of text and an associated pointer which can be moved by the user to indicate specific parts of an image. This tool was made with educational diagrams in mind, and will eventually be incorporated into a database-driven web app for creating, viewing, and storing educational anatomical images.
